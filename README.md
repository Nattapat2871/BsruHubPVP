# BsruHubPVP

BsruHubPVP is an advanced Player vs. Player management plugin designed for hub or event servers. It creates a controlled PVP environment where players must actively opt-in to combat by holding a specific item, receiving a full set of enchanted armor to fight. The system is fully configurable, from items and messages to sounds and leaderboards.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Opt-in PVP:** Players enter PVP mode by holding a special sword for a configurable amount of time.
- **Dynamic Armor:** Automatically equips players with a full set of enchanted diamond armor upon entering PVP mode and removes it upon exiting.
- **Controlled Environment:** PVP damage is only possible between players who are both in PVP mode (wearing the special armor).
- **Fully Configurable:** Almost every aspect of the plugin can be customized via `config.yml`, including all messages, sounds, item names, lores, and enchantments.
- **Unbreakable & Bound Items:** The PVP Sword is unbreakable, and the Divine Armor cannot be manually removed during combat.
- **Death Mechanics:** On death, players do not drop their inventory, except for the PVP Sword. Death messages are also suppressed to keep the chat clean.
- **Live Health Display:** Players in combat can see their opponent's health on their action bar.
- **Kill Leaderboard:** Tracks player kills and provides placeholders for leaderboards via PlaceholderAPI.
- **Admin Commands:** Includes commands for getting items and reloading the configuration, complete with tab-completion.
